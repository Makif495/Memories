## 🕯️ Story Overview

Our main character awakens in a **dark and unfamiliar room**, surrounded by shadows and silence.  
The only light comes from a **tiny glow emanating from themselves**, barely enough to see a few steps ahead.  

While exploring, they find a **hidden chest**. Inside lies something deeply personal — their **old elementary school pencil case**.  
By **dragging their childhood items** — a **pencil**, **ruler**, and **scissors** — back into the case, they complete a small puzzle.  

At that moment, something strange happens:  
the faint glow around them **grows slightly brighter**.  
They don’t understand why — but they feel a small spark of hope.  

As they move forward to the next room, they can’t help but wonder:  
> *Why is this memory here? What’s waiting in the next room?*
